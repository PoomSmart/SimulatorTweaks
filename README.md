SimulatorTweaks
==========

A collection of CydiaSubstrate tweaks for iOS Simulator I made for certain purposes.

Requirement
==========

* A working /Library/Frameworks/CydiaSubstrate.framework placed in simulator root directory (any SDK you have)
* [simject](https://github.com/angelXwind/simject)
* Latest branch of [Theos](https://github.com/theos/theos)

Camera Enabler
======

Allows uses of camera app. However, this doesn't include implementation of real photography.

FullSettings
======

Expanded settings options, gives better looks when you open settings and probably enables more controls to iOS.

exKeyboard-sim
======

An iOS Simulator version of [exKeyboard](https://github.com/PoomSmart/exKeyboard). It allows you to use third-party keyboard in any part of iOS.

Setup/Install tweaks to simject
======

```
